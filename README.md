This simulation solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations" target="_blank">Navier-Stokes equations</a> for incompressible fluid flow past an obstacle in a GPU fragment shader.
It exhibits a phenomenon called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_shedding" target="_blank">vortex shedding</a>,
where vortices of alternating spin spontaneously emerge behind the obstacle.
To increase performance, I solved for the velocity vector field of the fluid at a lower resolution than I used to compute the distribution of material moving through the fluid (shown in black and white).
I used bilinear interpolation to smooth out most artifacts caused by this speedup - though you can still see some artifacts around the boundary of the obstacle.
I ignored the viscous diffusion term from the Navier-Stokes formula to encourage better vortex formation (the implicit advection solving I'm using creates enough diffusion on its own for this system).
